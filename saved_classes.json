After a brief presentation of the field of Egyptology and Egyptian historiography, we will first discuss how the ancient Egyptian civilization was shaped by its environment, as it emerged, developed, saw the rise and fall of dynasties, and fell under the sway of foreign rulers. This course will also highlight the wide range of materials encountered in Egyptian archaeology\u2014architectural remains in secular, sacred, and funerary contexts; material culture (pottery, stone and wooden artifacts, artistic creations); human and faunal remains; written documents; iconographic material\u2014and will evaluate how they reflect the cultural, social, and political organization of each major period of Egyptian history. Special attention will be given to both Egypt\u2019s interconnections with its neighbors\u2014Nubians, Libyans, and inhabitants of Syria-Palestine\u2014and the impact of religion on the artistic production. This course will also discuss modern representations of ancient Egypt and the enduring symbols of the culture.\n", "Restrictions": [], "Offered": ["Fall", "Spring", ""], "Showing": true}]
